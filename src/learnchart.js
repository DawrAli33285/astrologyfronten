                                The houses represent the sky at the time of birth, divided into twelve parts. More specifically, the ecliptic, which is the path the planets move across in the sky. The houses form the skeletal structure of the chart and are always in the same location for everyone. They are numbered one through twelve.
                            </p>

                                In a western chart, like the one we are using, the beginning of the first house is the eastern horizon. This is also known as the rising sign, or the ascendant. This is the beginning of the chart and the houses start here. Beginning with the first house moving counterclockwise through the twelfth.
                            </p>

                                (Note that there are different house systems used by astrologers. The ascendant might be somewhere in the first house, or you might notice the houses aren't equal. The system we are using is the equal house system. This divides the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, starting from the ascendant. Feel free to use whichever system you prefer.)

                        Opposite the ascendant is the descendant. This is the western horizon, or what's setting. The top of the chart is the highest part of the ecliptic in the sky. The bottom of the chart is what is underneath the horizon, or the non-visible sky.

                        Since the houses represent the areas of the sky, in astrology the houses represent the <strong>areas of life</strong>.

                        For example, the first house represents all areas of life associated with the self. This includes our self-image, motivations, goals, and appearance. The houses represent what we call "areas of life".

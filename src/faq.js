          CHART INTERPRETATION & LEARNING
        </h2>

        <FAQItem id="interpretations" question="Do you use different interpretations than tropical astrology?">
          <p>
            No, <b>we use the same interpretations as mainstream Western astrology</b>. The tropical and sidereal interpretations are practically identical.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main difference is how we interpret the angles like the ascendant. While traditional astrology sees the ascendant as your "persona," we view the sidereal ascendant as who you are <b>becoming</b> - not what you were born with, but what life helps you develop. This is also true for the other angles such as the Midheaven, whereby the angle shows the life experiences not the personality characteristics.
          </p>
        </FAQItem>

        <FAQItem id="oppositions" question="How do you interpret oppositions that aren't opposite signs?">
          <p>
            In true sidereal, we still read them as oppositions - specifically, the <b>opposing parts</b> of those signs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Example:</b> Leo opposite Pisces<br />
            • The Leo part in opposition to Pisces emphasizes self-oriented, passionate desires and pursuits<br />
            • The Pisces part in opposition to Leo emphasizes selflessness and surrender to what life wants for us
          </p>
          <p>
            You don't need to get too technical - simply view them as opposites and you'll see how these energies can be balanced, even though they're not classically opposite signs.

            (Rahu and Ketu). They are the most important energies for life direction and cultivating balance between physical and spiritual needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In your chart, look for two horseshoe symbols - the 'n' is the North Node and the 'u' is the South Node. Note their house and sign placements. This is by far the most powerful part of the chart and what our readings are centered around.

        </FAQItem>

        <FAQItem id="node-vs-ascendant" question="How is the north node different from the ascendant?">
          <p>The key difference is <b>karma</b>:</p>
          <p>
            <b>The nodes</b> are karmic points. The north node represents karma you're building in this life. It requires careful balance with the south node to avoid extremes. Going too far into either node creates challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The ascendant and chart ruler</b> are simply this life's experiences without karmic weight. They're beneficial to develop without the same risk of imbalance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The nodes teach us balance through repeated cycles and life lessons. The angles like the ascendant show straightforward growth and development.

        <FAQItem id="degrees" question="Do you use degrees with true sidereal astrology?">
          <p>
            You can. However, we personally don't use degrees with true sidereal. Since true sidereal uses the <b>actual uneven sizes of the constellations</b>, degrees become ambiguous. Degrees are useful when signs are an even 30-degrees, but in true sidereal the signs are different sizes, so degrees don't have practical meaning.

        <FAQItem id="iau-dates" question="Are the IAU dates (Nov 30 - Dec 17 for Ophiuchus) correct?">
          <p>
            The IAU boundaries you see on Wikipedia are <b>for astronomy, not astrology</b>. They don't reference the ecliptic (the Sun's path). We use the{' '}
            <a href="https://masteringthezodiac.com/midpoint-method" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">
              Midpoint Method
            </a>
            , which is more accurate for astrology as it references the ecliptic. With this method, the Sun is in Ophiuchus from <b>December 7th-18th</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also please keep in mind that there are no visible divisions in the sky. Dates within three days of two signs are a blend of both signs.
          </p>
        </FAQItem>

        <FAQItem id="13-houses" question="If there's a 13th sign, why not 13 houses?">
          <p>
            We use 12 houses because <b>Scorpio and Ophiuchus share the same part of the sky</b> - the 8th house region.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you look at the constellations, they span above and below each other perfectly along the ecliptic. Both carry 8th house energies of transformation and depth. This is why the 12-house system remains accurate even with 13 zodiac signs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you were to include a 13th house it would be the second half of the 8th - where Ophiuchus sits in the sky.
          </p>
        </FAQItem>

        <FAQItem id="equal-house" question="Why do you use Equal House system instead of Placidus?">
          <p>
            We prefer Equal House because it shows <b>the sky as we actually see it</b>. Other systems stretch and shrink houses to fit other points in the chart. For example, quadrant house systems like Placidus stretch and shrink the houses to North, East, South, and West. Another example is the Whole Sign house system which sets the houses to the zodiac signs. While these systems are accurate, Equal House provides a more fundamental view by keeping the sky's natural proportions.
          </p>
          <p>
            We still find other house systems like Placidus accurate. We just find that Equal House best represents the visible sky without distortion.

        <FAQItem id="astrocartography" question="Is sidereal astrocartography different from tropical?">
          <p><b>No, they're identical.</b></p>
          <p>
            Astrocartography charts reference the <b>houses</b> planets are in, not the signs. The planetary lines show where planets fall on the four angles (North, East, South, West) - their house positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since houses remain the same in both systems, your astrocartography map is unchanged whether using tropical or sidereal.
